# README
The purpose of this exercise is to basically convert an existing list of tuples (Games), into a searchable dictionary and a text file, that can still filter games by their console, duration, average rating, number of players, and favorites. The user should also be able to add a game to the dictionary. The user should also be able to add a game with the relevant information to the file and dictionary.

*The tuple is broken up as follows (Name of Game(str), Which Console(str), Avg. Duration in hours(float), Avg. Rating(float), Number of Max Players(int), Favorite(Bool)).*

## The brief:
1. Your software should first convert the list into a dictionary and add the list to the text file. (You should not be converting it into a dictionary manually. Make sure you are writing functions/code that does it for you!)
2. Your software should allow the user to filter the games being searched from the dictionary by the console, duration, average rating, number of players, and if it is considered a favorite. And then it should print out these games on the console. (Be creative, you can tackle this with our toolset in a variety of ways. Just try to avoid using a list. This is an exercise to practice dictionaries and persistence mainly.)
3. Your software should allow the user to add a game with it's relevant information to your dictionary and your text file.
