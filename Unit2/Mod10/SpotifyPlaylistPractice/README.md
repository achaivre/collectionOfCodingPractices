# README
You are going to make a music listening software. The software has four presaved playlists to the dictionary.

### Levels of difficulty:
Each level is meant to make the creation of this software a little more difficult.

### Level 1:
1. Your software should print out the song that they are playing.
2. It should let the user change the playlist they are playing.
3. Print out the list of songs on the playlist, the description and the name of the playlist.
4. Choose a song to play on the playlist.


### Level 2:
1. It should do the above and allow the user to hit [next] or [back] on the playlist to move to the next song. It should loop through the entirety of the list.
2. Add the ability to type any song/artist using any kind of case (not case sensitive)


### Level 3:
1. Let the user add songs to the playlist and it cycle through the songs and preserve them if you go back to the playlist to play them.
2. It should let the user make a new playlist to add to the dictionary.
