Extra Practice if we get to it:

Paying with a gift card:
1. You should create a software that asks the user if they will be paying with a gift card.
2. If they are paying with a gift card, you should prompt them for the total amount they spent, and the amount on the gift card.
3. If the gift card has some left over, it should print the amount left on the gift card.
4. If the amount is over the gift card, it should print the amount left to pay.
5. If the user is not paying with a gift card, you should prompt them to pay the total amount they provide and ask if they are doing cash or card.
6. The program should quit after one use and should have proper user input validation functions.
7. You should have at least two functions besides a main function.
